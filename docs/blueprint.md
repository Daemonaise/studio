- 3D Model Uploader & Preview: Allow users to upload STL, OBJ, and 3MF files, with a visual preview of their 3D models for configuration.
- Guided Quote Wizard: A multi-step, form-driven wizard for users to specify print processes, materials, dimensions, and other manufacturing parameters.
- Dynamic Cost & Lead Time Estimation: Placeholder logic to present a structured breakdown of material, machine time, reinforcement, handling, shipping costs, and an estimated lead time range.
- AI Engineering Assistant: An interactive chat tool to recommend optimal materials based on part usage and to explain complex tradeoffs between strength, print time, and cost.
- Materials & Specifications Catalog: A browsable grid of detailed material cards, displaying properties like stiffness, durability, and typical use cases in a datasheet-style format.
- Order Status Timeline: A stub page showcasing the progress of submitted orders through stages: Submitted, Quoted, Approved, In Production, Shipped.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Predominantly light with a white background (#FFFFFF). Primary color: A controlled, engineering blue (#2671E2). Background tint: A very subtle, desaturated blue-grey (#F5FBFE) to add depth. Accent color: A vibrant, electric cyan (#0CCCD2) for calls-to-action and highlights. Text color: Charcoal/graphite (#333333) for high readability.
- Headline and body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, objective, and clean aesthetic that maintains high legibility. Monospace font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for technical specifications, data readouts, and engineering notes.
- Minimalist, precise, line-art vector icons are preferred, emphasizing clarity and functionality. Avoid any decorative or illustrative styles, and no emojis, to maintain the clean, clinical brand tone.
- Mobile-first responsive design. Layouts will be clean and grid-based, utilizing sharp-edged cards and thin, crisp dividers to delineate content. Precise spacing and alignment will convey a sense of order and high-tech precision. Essential UI elements, like 'Get a Quote' and 'Submit Quote Request' CTAs, will be persistently visible, especially in the quote wizard (sticky bottom CTA).
- Animations will be subtle and purely functional, serving to enhance usability rather than add flair. This includes smooth transitions between steps in the multi-step quote wizard and informative skeleton loaders during data fetching or estimate generation to indicate system activity.
